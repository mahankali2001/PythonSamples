1. Example: Implement a function to detect a cycle in a linked list.
2. Example: Design an algorithm to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
3. String Manipulation: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Approach: Utilize the sliding window technique with two pointers to track the current substring and a set to store unique characters. Adjust the window as you encounter repeating characters to maintain the longest possible substring without duplicates.

4. Array Processing: Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

Approach: Implement a hash map to store the difference between the target and each element as you iterate through the array. This allows for constant-time lookups to check if the complement exists, achieving an overall linear time complexity.

5. Linked List Operations: Reverse a singly linked list.

Approach: Iterate through the linked list, reversing the pointers of each node to point to the previous node. Maintain references to the current, previous, and next nodes to facilitate the reversal process without losing track of the list.

6. Tree Traversal: Perform a level-order traversal of a binary tree.

Approach: Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level. Enqueue the root node, then iteratively dequeue nodes, processing their values, and enqueue their child nodes until all levels are traversed.

7. Dynamic Programming: Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money in each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police (cannot rob two adjacent houses).

Approach: Apply dynamic programming by maintaining an array where each element at index i represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to house i. The recurrence relation considers the maximum of robbing the current house plus the amount from two houses back, or skipping the current house to take the maximum from the previous house.

8. Graph Algorithms: Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph traversal.

Approach: For DFS, use a stack (either explicitly or via recursion) to explore as far along each branch as possible before backtracking. For BFS, use a queue to explore all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

9. Sorting Algorithms: Implement the quicksort algorithm.

Approach: Choose a pivot element and partition the array such that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater are on the right. Recursively apply this partitioning to the subarrays to achieve a sorted array.

10. Matrix Operations: Rotate a given n x n matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

Approach: First, transpose the matrix by swapping elements at [i][j] with [j][i]. Then, reverse each row to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

11. Heap Operations: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.

Approach: Utilize a min-heap of size k. As you iterate through the array, maintain the heap such that it contains the largest k elements encountered. The root of the heap will represent the kth largest element.

12. Bit Manipulation: Determine if an integer is a power of two.

Approach: A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. Check this by ensuring the number is greater than zero and that performing a bitwise AND between the number and its predecessor yields zero (i.e., n & (n - 1) == 0).
